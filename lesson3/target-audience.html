                <P>
                    People in need of medical assistance, surgery, or cancer are the major audience of the Suncity Chamber of Commerce for Health. This site is here to help you because health problems impact people of all ages, young and old. Because of the difficult living conditions in rural areas, people in these locations are the most likely to be targeted. 
                    At heart, older people are also. This organization is dedicated to assisting our aging grandparents.
                </P>
